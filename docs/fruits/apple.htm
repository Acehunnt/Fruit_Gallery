<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus pumila).
Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.
Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America 
by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, 
including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.</p>
<p>There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Cultivars vary in their yield and the 
ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.Different cultivars are available 
for temperate and subtropical climates.</p>
