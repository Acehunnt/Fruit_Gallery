<p>The apricot is a small tree, 8–12 m (26–39 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 40 cm (16 in) in diameter 
and a dense, spreading canopy. The leaves are ovate, 5–9 cm (2.0–3.5 in) long and 4–8 cm (1.6–3.1 in) 
wide, with a rounded base, a pointed tip and a finely serrated margin. The flowers are 2–4.5 cm (0.8–1.8 in) 
in diameter, with five white to pinkish petals; they are produced singly or in pairs in early spring before 
the leaves. The fruit is a drupe similar to a small peach, 1.5–2.5 cm (0.6–1.0 in) diameter (larger in some 
modern cultivars), from yellow to orange, often tinged red on the side most exposed to the sun; its surface 
can be smooth (botanically described as: glabrous) or velvety with very short hairs (botanically: pubescent). 
The flesh is usually firm and not very juicy. Its taste can range from sweet to tart. The single seed is 
enclosed in a hard, stony shell, often called a "stone" or "kernel", with a grainy, smooth texture except 
for three ridges running down one side.
