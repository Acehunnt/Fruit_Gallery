<p>The avocado (Persea americana) is a tree, long thought to have originated in South Central Mexico, 
classified as a member of the flowering plant family Lauraceae. The fruit of the plant, 
also called an avocado (or avocado pear or alligator pear), is botanically a large berry containing 
a single large seed known as a "pit" or a "stone".</p>
<p>Avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and Mediterranean climates 
throughout the world. They have a green-skinned, fleshy body that may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, 
or spherical. Commercially, they ripen after harvesting. Avocado trees are partially self-pollinating 
and are often propagated through grafting to maintain a predictable quality and quantity of the fruit.
