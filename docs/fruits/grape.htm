<p>Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, 
jam, juice, jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil. 
Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.</p>
<p>Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, 
black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. "White" grapes are actually green 
in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. Mutations in two 
regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are 
responsible for the color of purple grapes.
