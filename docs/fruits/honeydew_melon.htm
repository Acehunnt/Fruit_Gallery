<p>A honeydew has a round to slightly oval shape, typically 15–22 cm (5.9–8.7 in) long. 
It generally ranges in weight from 1.8 to 3.6 kg (4.0 to 7.9 lb). The flesh is usually pale green 
in color, while the smooth peel ranges from greenish to yellow. Like most fruit, honeydew has seeds. 
The inner flesh is eaten, often for dessert, and honeydew is commonly found in supermarkets across the 
world alongside cantaloupe melons and watermelons. In California, honeydew is in season from August until October.</p>
<p>This fruit grows best in semiarid climates and is harvested based on maturity, not size. 
Maturity can be hard to judge, but it is based upon the ground color ranging from greenish white 
(immature) to creamy yellow (mature).
