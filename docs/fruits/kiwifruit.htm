<p>Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species 
of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.[1][2] The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit ('Hayward') 
is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) 
in diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or golden flesh with rows of 
tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture, with a sweet and unique flavor. China produced 
56% of the world total of kiwifruit in 2016.
