<p>A lime (from French lime, from Arabic līma, from Persian līmū, "lemon") 
is a hybrid citrus fruit, which is typically round, green in color, 3–6 centimetres (1.2–2.4 in) 
in diameter, and contains acidic juice vesicles.</p>
<p>There are several species of citrus trees whose fruits are called limes, including the Key lime 
(Citrus aurantifolia), Persian lime, kaffir lime, and desert lime. Limes are a rich source of vitamin C, 
sour and are often used to accent the flavours of foods and beverages. They are grown year-round. 
Plants with fruit called "limes" have diverse genetic origins; limes do not form a monophyletic group.
