<p>The mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), also known as the mandarin or mandarine, 
is a small citrus tree with fruit resembling other oranges, usually eaten plain or in 
fruit salads. Specifically reddish-orange mandarin cultivars can be marketed as tangerines, 
but this is not a botanical classification.</p>
<p>Mandarins are smaller and oblate, rather than spherical like the common oranges 
(which are a mandarin hybrid). The taste is considered less sour, as well as sweeter and stronger. 
A ripe mandarin is firm to slightly soft, heavy for its size, and pebbly-skinned. The peel is very thin, 
with very little bitter white mesocarp,[2] so they are usually easier to peel and to split into segments. 
Hybrids generally have these traits to a lesser degree.
