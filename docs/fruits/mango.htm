<p>Mangoes are juicy stone fruit (drupe) from numerous species of tropical trees belonging to the 
flowering plant genus Mangifera, cultivated mostly for their edible fruit.</p>
<p>The majority of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes. The genus belongs to the 
cashew family Anacardiaceae. Mangoes are native to South Asia,[1][2] from where the "common mango" or 
"Indian mango", Mangifera indica, has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most widely 
cultivated fruits in the tropics. Other Mangifera species (e.g. horse mango, Mangifera foetida) 
are grown on a more localized basis.
