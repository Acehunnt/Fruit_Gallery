<p>Passiflora edulis is a vine species of passion flower that is native to southern Brazil through 
Paraguay and northern Argentina.[1] Its common names include passion fruit or passionfruit (English), 
maracujá (Portuguese) maracuyá or parcha (Spanish), grenadille or fruit de la passion (French) or lilikoʻi 
(Hawaiian) and mburukuja (Guaraní).</p>
<p>It is cultivated commercially in tropical and subtropical areas for its sweet, seedy fruit. 
The passion fruit is a pepo, a type of berry, round to oval, either yellow or dark purple at maturity, 
with a soft to firm, juicy interior filled with numerous seeds. The fruit is both eaten and juiced; 
passion fruit juice is often added to other fruit juices to enhance aroma.
