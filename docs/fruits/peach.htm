<p>The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between 
the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Mountains, where it was first domesticated and 
cultivated.[3] It bears an edible juicy fruit called a peach or a nectarine.</p>
<p>The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), 
from where it was transplanted to Europe. It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, 
apricot, almond and plum, in the rose family.
